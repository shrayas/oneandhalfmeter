#OneAndHalfMeter

OneAndHalfMeter is a simple android application that helps out with calculating the deadly "one and a half meter" charge. 

Its major use is in a city like Bangalore, India .. The place where i live , where after 10:00PM everyone who uses an autorickshaw is expected to pay the auto fare + half of the auto fare .. Sucks , i know. 

In **addition** to this , the govt. also increased the minimum rate from Rs. 17 to Rs. 20 affecting the base price as well . 

Anyway , its simple to use .. You can find it [here](#) on the play store (Not yet) or just grab the source and build it yourself :)

Will put up screenshots as we go along. 

Cheers.
